# README

This is me trying to get a basic hotwire rails app. working.

The code is based on:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp6sxgjA-xY
- https://github.com/gorails-screencasts/hotwire-twitter-clone

But, I started from a fresh rails 7 app. using ruby 3.1.1 and node 17

## Pre-requisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [dip gem](https://github.com/bibendi/dip)

## Install and run

- Clone this repo
- cd into repo
- `make init` or `dip provision`
- `make server` or `dip up`

See [this blog
post](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/ruby-on-whales-docker-for-ruby-rails-development)
for more details on how to use this setup for rails development.
